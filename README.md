# Parachute-Retracting-Device
Unmanned Arial Surveillance Vehicles(UAV) have greater difficulty to move around after landing as parachute caused inconvenience. This project is based on designing a subsystem whose objective is to retract the parachute which is used after landing of UAV. This helps UAV to move around freely.
