# Parachute-Retracting-Device
Unmanned Arial Surveillance Vehicles(UAV) have greater difficulty to move around after landing as parachute caused inconvenience. This project is based on designing a subsystem whose objective is to retract the parachute which is used after landing of UAV. This helps UAV to move around freely. It also helps in reusing the deployed parachute by reducing the cost on multiple parachutes.

A Five step engineering design process was adopted to design the subsystem. The background
and existing solutions for the design of the parachute retracting subsystem was understood
through the phase of literature survey. This also aided in establishing the design considerations,
functionalities and constraints. The next phase was to sketch multiple feasible concepts. By
applying pairwise comparison chart, the choice of the most appropriate design was made. The
phase of detailed design, the AUTOCAD drawings, program and circuit followed. The last phase
is the testing and implementation of the data we have collected from the later phases.

The designed system is a movable four wheeled bot with a parachute rolling mechanism, which
retracts the parachute within ten seconds. Also, we could overcome wear and tear of
parachute, hence achieving the objective of reusability. In future, we can improvise the device
by deploying cased parachute and use more advanced mechanisms to retract the parachute.
